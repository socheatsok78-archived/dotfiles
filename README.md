# .dotfile â€” My personal dotfile environments

### :warning: Use at your own risk
You should only use this on a **fresh installed system!**
This is a personal `dotfile` environment, I intend to use on ***my own system***, but if you insist to use the same environment as I do, please know that you're on your own.

I'm **not responsible** for any damage done to your **system\computer**. Please review the source code before using.

But if you enjoy it please give it a :star:!

Dotfiles are files and folders on Unix-like systems starting with . that control the configuration of applications and shells on your system. You can store and manage your dotfiles in a repository on GitHub. For advice and tutorials about what to include in your dotfiles repository, see [Personalizing Codespaces for your account][personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account] or [GitHub does dotfiles][github-dotfiles].

There are some great dotfiles around:

## Troubleshooting

**compinit: insecure directories**:

If you somehow have the following issues, do the following

```sh
# zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
# Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?

compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

### Development

For development you can use the following command to pull all `dotfiles` and `dotfiles-*` repository listed in `.github/clone`.

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/socheatsok78/dotfiles/main/.github/clone)"
```
