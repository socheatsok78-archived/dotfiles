### :warning: Use at your own risk
**You should only use this on a fresh installed system!**
This is a personal `dotfile` environment, ***I intend to use for my own system***, but if you insist to use the same environment as I do, please know that you're on your own.

I'm **not responsible** for any damage done to your **system\computer**. Please review the source code before using. You could check the **[Travis Build Status][travis-ci-status]** for more information.

But if you enjoy it please give it a star :star:!
